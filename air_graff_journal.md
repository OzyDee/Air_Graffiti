# Air Graffiti — Journal Entry 1

**Project:** Air Graffiti  
**Date:** 01/09/2025

## Concept Overview

This week, I kicked off my project idea for Air Graffiti. The core concept is a web-based graffiti simulation that turns a smartphone into a virtual spray can. By using the phone’s motion sensors, I can track how the device is tilted and moved, allowing the user to “spray” digital paint onto a canvas.

## Key Features Planned

- **Motion-Controlled Painting:** The phone’s orientation (tilt up, down, left, right) will control the position and flow of the digital spray, mimicking the feel of using a real can of paint.
- **Photo-Wall Mode:** Users can take a photo of a real wall and then paint over it digitally. This will help them visualize how their graffiti would look in a real-world context.
- **Graffiti Styles:** I’ll include different colours, spray patterns, drips, and textures to keep it authentic to graffiti culture.
- **Save Functionality:** After creating their art, users can save the final image.

## Goals for Next Steps

- Prototype the motion-to-paint mapping and test it on a basic canvas.
- Implement a simple interface to switch between a blank canvas and a photo background.

## Progress This Week

This week I made solid progress by integrating the device camera into the app. Users can now capture a photo directly from their phone and use that photo as a canvas background. I also set up a basic interface that allows switching between a blank canvas and the newly captured photo.

## Achievements

- **Camera Functionality:** I can now take a picture within the app and use it as the background. This is a big step toward the Photo-Wall mode I envisioned.
- **Basic UI:** I’ve got a simple interface that lets users switch between a standard blank canvas and the photo they’ve taken.

## Challenges

- **Motion Sensor Issues:** While the camera is working well, I'm still facing some connectivity challenges with the motion sensors. I'm able to get the camera feed reliably, but the sensor data for motion control is still inconsistent. I’ll continue troubleshooting that.

## Next Steps

- Resolve the motion sensor connectivity so that the phone’s tilt and movement can control the spray.  
- Refine the painting tools and brush styles now that we have a working background feature.


# Air Graffiti — Journal Entry 3

## Progress This Week

In my third week, I’ve brought almost all the pieces together. The camera and UI are working smoothly, and I've integrated the painting tools so that users can spray paint on either a blank canvas or a photo background. I’ve refined the look and feel of the brushes and the colour options. 

## Achievements

- **Full Integration:** The main features are now connected and functioning. I can paint with different colours and styles on top of the captured photo or a blank background.
- **UI Polish:** I’ve made the interface cleaner and more intuitive, with buttons to switch modes, pick colours, and save the final artwork.

## Challenges

- **Motion Sensor Connectivity on iPhone:** I'm still experiencing issues with the motion sensors, especially on iPhone (i think). Both Chrome and Safari are having trouble consistently accessing the orientation data. It might be a permissions or browser setting issue, so I’ll keep investigating that.

## Next Steps

- Troubleshoot iPhone motion sensor connectivity further and ensure consistent access in both Chrome and Safari.
- Finalise and test the save functionality so users can easily download their finished graffiti images.
